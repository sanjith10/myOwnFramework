
gitYou can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.
2.	Open Git Bash.
3.	Change the current working directory to your local project.
4.	Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
5.	git init
6.	Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
7.	git add .
8.	# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
9.	Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
10.	git commit -m "First commit"
11.	# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.


At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.
12.	In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
13.	git remote add origin remote repository URL
14.	# Sets the new remote
15.	git remote -v
16.	# Verifies the new remote URL
17.	Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
18.	git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin


Case 1: Don’t care about local changes

Solution 1: Get the latest code and reset the code

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/[tag/branch/commit-id usually: master]
Solution 2: Delete the folder and clone again :D

rm -rf [project_folder]
git clone [remote_repo]
Case 2: Care about local changes

Solution 1: no conflicts with new-online version

git fetch origin
git status
will report something like:

Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
Then get the latest version

git pull
Solution 2: conflicts with new-online version

git fetch origin (It will get new feature branches also)
git status
will report something like:
git 
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
    file_name
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Aborting
Commit your local changes

git add .
git commit -m ‘Commit msg’
Try to get the changes (will fail)

git pull
will report something like:

Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.
Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'
as appropriate to mark resolution, or use 'git commit -a'.
Open the conflict file and fix the conflict. Then:

git add .
git commit -m ‘Fix conflicts’
git pull
will report something like:

Already up-to-date.

I suspect that what's happened may be that you've deleted the files that you modified (because you didn't care about those changes) and now git is taking the deletion to be a change.

Here is an approach that moves your changes out of your working copy and into the "stash" (retrievable should it actually turn out that you ever need them again), so you can then pull the latest changes down from the upstream.

git stash  
git pull
If you ever want to retrieve your files (potential conflicts with upstream changes and all), run a git stash apply to stick those changes on top of your code. That way, you have an "undo" approach.

git pull origin master

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
